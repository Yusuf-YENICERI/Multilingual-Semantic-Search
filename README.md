# Multilingual Semantic Search 🌐

This Colab notebook provides a simple and effective way to perform semantic search similarity using the FAISS library for various languages, including Turkish. Semantic search allows you to search for similar content based on their meaning rather than relying solely on exact keyword matches. 🔍✨

## Features 🚀

- **Language Agnostic:** This notebook is designed to work with any language, making it versatile and adaptable to various use cases. 🌍🗣️

- **FAISS Integration:** The notebook leverages the FAISS library, a powerful tool for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. 📚🔍

- **Turkish Language Support:** One of the highlights of this notebook is its compatibility with the Turkish language, enabling semantic search in Turkish. 🇹🇷🔤

## Usage 📝

1. **Upload your dataset:** Prepare your dataset of text documents or sentences in the language of your choice, including Turkish. 📄

2. **Install Dependencies:** The notebook includes installation steps for required libraries such as FAISS. Follow the setup instructions to ensure everything runs smoothly. 🛠️📦

3. **Load and Encode Data:** Load your dataset and use a suitable text encoder (e.g., sentence-transformers) to transform the text into dense vector representations. 📊🔢

4. **Build FAISS Index:** Construct an index using FAISS, which will allow for efficient semantic similarity searches. 🏗️📈

5. **Perform Semantic Search:** Input a query text, encode it into a vector, and use the FAISS index to find the most similar documents or sentences in your dataset. 🔎📑

6. **Explore Results:** Analyze and interpret the search results to gain insights into semantic similarities within your dataset. 📊🧐
